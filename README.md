## The Experiment

Solcoins is an experiment in pure stupidity that might just be genius. 500 pixelated coin NFTs that you can only mint with $COINS tokens - no SOL needed.

Minting costs 500,000 $COINS tokens per NFT. Each coin is minted based on availability. When all 500 are minted, minting closes.

Changed your mind? Swap your NFT back for the same 500,000 tokens anytime. The NFT burns and opens a new slot. Your tokens are safely stored in a PDA vault that only you control.

## Earn Dividends

**Hold a Solcoin, earn passive income.**

Every Solcoin NFT holder automatically receives a proportional share of all pump.fun creator fees generated by $COINS token trading.

### How It Works
- 100% of creator fees are distributed among all minted NFT holders
- Your share = (100% ÷ total minted NFTs) × number of NFTs you hold
- Claims available every 6 hours (4 claim windows per 24 hours)
- Fees are automatically collected and distributed through smart contracts

### Example
- **140 NFTs minted**, you hold **4 NFTs**
- Per-NFT share: 100% ÷ 140 = 0.714%
- Your share: 0.714% × 4 = **2.857%**
- With 10 SOL in daily creator fees: **0.286 SOL per day** or **2 SOL per week**

### Early Minter Advantage
The fewer NFTs minted, the higher your percentage share. At full mint (500 NFTs), each represents exactly 0.2% of all fees. Early minters benefit from significantly larger dividend shares.

## The Market Psychology

If Solcoins takes off, token prices spike and minting becomes expensive. Accessible pixel art becomes exclusive digital artifacts. Success creates scarcity, scarcity drives demand.

Don't believe it? Swap back anytime for your 500,000 tokens. The vault keeps everything fair.

## What Can You Do With A Solcoin?

Beyond earning passive dividends:
- **Show it off** - Use it as your profile picture
- **Earn income** - Collect creator fee dividends every 6 hours
- **Trade it** - Classic supply and demand with income-generating assets
- **Collect them** - Stack multiple NFTs for higher dividend percentages
- **Early mint** - Get in early for maximum dividend share

Each Solcoin is completely unique and generates passive income.

## The Vision

**Imagine...**

$COINS tokens skyrocket. Minting a single Solcoin costs thousands. Trading volume explodes, generating massive creator fees for holders. Nobody wants to swap back - why burn a dividend-generating NFT?

The vault becomes a historical archive. 500 pixelated coins, each one a passive income stream from the early days when we thought this was just a joke. We accidentally created the most exclusive, most profitable pixel art collection on Solana.

The ultimate proof that anything can become valuable if it generates real income.
