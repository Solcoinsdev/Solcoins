## The Experiment

Solcoins is an experiment in pure stupidity that might just be genius. We made 500 pixelated coin NFTs that you can only mint with $COINS tokens. No SOL needed - just our tokens to get in.

Want to mint one? It costs 500,000 $COINS tokens. Each coin is minted based on availability - once it's taken, you can't mint that specific one again. When all 500 NFTs are minted, minting gets disabled completely.

But here's the thing - you can always swap your NFT back for the same 500,000 tokens if you change your mind. When you swap back, that specific NFT gets burned and opens up a new slot for someone else to mint. We use a mint vault system where your tokens get safely stored in a PDA vault when you mint.

## How It Works

If Solcoins somehow takes off, our token price shoots up. Now minting gets crazy expensive. What started as cheap pixel art turns into exclusive stuff only rich people can buy.

The bigger we get, the harder it becomes for normal people to afford. The harder it gets to afford, the more people want it. It's this weird cycle where success makes us more exclusive, and being exclusive makes people want us more.

Don't believe this will work? No problem - just swap your NFT back for your 500,000 tokens. The vault keeps everything fair and lets you exit whenever you want.

## What Can You Do With A Solcoin?

Absolutely nothing productive, and that's the point.

- **Show it off** - Use it as your profile picture on socials
- **Brag about it** - Tell friends you own a piece of digital absurdity  
- **Trade it** - Classic supply and demand on meaningless pixels
- **Collect them** - Because why not?

Each Solcoin is completely unique and equally useless.

## The Vision

**Imagine...**

What if this actually takes off? $COINS tokens skyrocket from pennies to dollars. Suddenly, minting a single Solcoin costs thousands of real money. Nobody wants to swap back anymore - why would you burn a valuable NFT for tokens worth more than the art itself?

The vault becomes a historical archive. 500 pixelated coins, each one a digital artifact from the early days when we thought this was just a joke. We accidentally created the most exclusive, most pointless, most expensive pixel art collection on Solana.

The ultimate proof that anything - literally anything - can become valuable if enough people decide it is.
